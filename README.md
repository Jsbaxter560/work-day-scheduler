# work-day-scheduler
I was *highly* motivated to have a better result from this project than last. In this project we were given starter code to be edited and augmented with a js file.
## Getting started
Due to my deep need to focus an unfortunate amount of time on rudimentary drills, I got a *woefully* late start.
## Tutor time helps!
My tutoring session with Sam was extremely fruitful, and I appreciate that he is still my tutor. 1 particular thing was an eficiency shortcut he showed me involving holding the alt key and mirroring the cursor in a number of locations on the document to edit simultaneously. This strikes me as a shortcut that could introduce error without proper ussage, and should be used with care.
## Event listener checks out
After console logging that the click function was active on the save buttons, I was able to fix the user input into the clicked object.
